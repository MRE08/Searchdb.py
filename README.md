# Searchdb.py
Searches the database using the keyfields, id and name
The code connects to your database
So if you want to use this code, simple connect using your settings
Right now, it searches with the keyfield 'id','firstname','lastname'.
Simply copy pasting the functions can make the code better

Thank you!
